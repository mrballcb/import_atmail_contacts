OVERVIEW

This plugin will import contacts from Atmail to Roundcube on login.  When
enabled, it checks on every login to see if it needs to import contacts
from Atmail's database.  It will do nothing if the logging-in user already
has more than one contact in Roundcube.  Rephrased: after a successful
import has previously run, the plugin will immediately exit on subsequent
logins because it detects contacts.

USAGE
